# CustomListProj
Summary: Creates a wrapper around an array that represents a strongly typed list of objects that can be accessed by index. 
Provides methods to add, remove, remove at, sort, merge, and manipulate lists.


Simliar to the C# List<T> except it's grass-fed free-range organic gluten-free vegan holistic cruelty-free and of course, tastier.
